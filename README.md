This is our class repository. That means that this page will store all of our
required files for the class. You will each create your own repositories on
GitHub and "fork" the files listed here.

In addition to our repository, you will need a few tools to better understand
our work. I have the listed below.

1. <a href="geojson.io">GeoJSON.io</a>
GeoJSON.io is a website that will help us understand the relationship between
geographical data (the stuff we collect) and the code that visualizes it
(Javascript). We will use this as a reference throughout the class to customize
our map.

2. <a href="atom.io">Atom.io</a>
Atom is a text editor that we will use to write our code and "push" our project
GitHub. There are instructions for how to download and customize Atom in The
atominstructions.txt file. This file also contains instructions detailing how
you will "fork" this repository.

3. <a href="https://www.academia.edu/37786062/Deep_Mapping">Deep Mapping</a>
If you want to get a better handle on the methodology for mapping projects like
ours, I recommend the book Deep Mapping by Brett Bloom and Nuno Sacramento. The
link about will allow you download the entire book (it's short, less than 100
pages) with Google.
